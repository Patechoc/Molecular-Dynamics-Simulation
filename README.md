# Molecular Dynamics Simulation
For my Applied Math senior capstone project I am creating a browser-based, dynamic, 3-dimensional simulation of organic molecules. Inspired by the interactivity of D3.jsâ€™ Force Layout, my goal is to augment the classic ball and stick representation of organic molecules to reflect the dynamic relationship of atoms. Using a force-based layout scheme for graph drawing and a Newtonian mechanical model for molecular motion I will implement the simulation as a front-end web application such that it can be run entirely on a web browser. For more information on the my mathematical model and implementation check out my project proposal.
